# File Organizer

The File Organizer is a Python script that helps you organize files in a directory by categorizing them into subdirectories based on their file extensions (e.g., images, documents, videos).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Clone this repository or download the Python script to your computer.

2. **Set Source and Target Directories**: Open the Python script and set the source and target directories where you want to organize your files.

```python
source_directory = "path_to_your_source_directory"
target_directory = "path_to_your_target_directory"
```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script in your terminal or command prompt.

4. **Files Organized**: The script will scan the source directory, categorize files based on their extensions, and move them to the target directory.

## Caution

- Ensure you back up your files before running the script, as it involves moving and organizing files.

## Customization

You can customize this script to suit your specific needs. For example, you can define your own categories or file extensions, or modify the source and target directories.
